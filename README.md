# RandomizeProjectMembers
A script for google sheets that randomly assigns members to projects

You can see the document here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sxzyJJRuaFGX7V5Z9VUX-E6lHPLUDD1WAWrIPj3TzOw/edit?usp=sharing

To use the sheet, you go to File -> Make a Copy. Once you have your copy, go to the ProjectList sheet, fill it out according to the format guide on the first sheet, set your max group size on the first sheet, and click the randomize button. This will ask your permission to execute the script. You'll have to click advanced -> allow anyway (unsafe) or whatever it is depending on your browser.
